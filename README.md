# MedDataRD – Analysis of Deaths and Injuries from Traffic Accidents

## 📌 Description
This project analyzes historical data on deaths and injuries from traffic accidents in the Dominican Republic over the past few years.

The objective is to identify temporal patterns, monthly and annual trends, and indications of seasonality using exploratory data analysis and statistical visualization.

This repository is part of my **MedDataRD – data-driven** project.
